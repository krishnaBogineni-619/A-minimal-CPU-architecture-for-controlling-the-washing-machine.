# A-minimal-CPU-architecture-for-controlling-the-washing-machine.


We divided the architecture of our washing machine model into 6 parts
1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
 For a minimal CPU architecture, we can use a simplified instruction set with basic
operations such as load, store, add, subtract, compare, jump, and branch instructions.
2. Processor:
 The CPU can be a single-core microcontroller based on a reduced instruction set
computer (RISC) architecture. A popular choice for minimal CPU designs is the ARM
Cortex-M series, such as Cortex-M0 or Cortex-M3.
3. Memory:
 The CPU would require a small amount of memory for program storage and data
manipulation. We can use Flash memory for program storage and RAM for data storage.
The size of the memory will depend on the complexity of the washing machine control
logic.
4. Input/Output (I/O):
 The CPU needs to interact with various components of the washing machine. Some
possible I/O components include:
 -Type of cloth we have put inside the model.
 - Keypad or buttons: Allow users to input commands and settings.
 - Display: Show status, settings, and feedback to the user.
 - Sensors: Measure parameters like water level, temperature, and motor speed.
 - Actuators: Control the motor, valves, pumps, and other mechanical components.
 - Communication interfaces: Optional interfaces such as UART, I2C, or SPI for
external communication, e.g., connecting to a mobile app or home automation system.
5. Interrupts:
 The CPU should support interrupt handling to respond to time-critical events such as
button presses or sensor readings. Interrupts can trigger specific actions or initiate context
switches.
6. Power Management:
 Consider adding power management features to conserve energy when the washing
machine is idle or not in use. This could involve sleep modes or dynamic clock scaling to
reduce power consumption.
